.SH NETWORK TYPES


.B bridged
.P
Bridged networks are just that, simple straight layer 2 bridges.  Freight nodes
running containers attached to networks of this type will create a bridge,
attach a physical interface to the bridge, create a veth pair, attach one end to
the bridge and pass the other end to the container.


.SH ADDRESS CONFIG
The address config section ennumerates how a container on this network will
obtain an address.  Current supported formats are dhcp, slaac and static.  Note
that static assignment is of limited usefulness as it only allows one address
asignment per network.

.SH NETWORK TYPE CONFIGURATIONS
