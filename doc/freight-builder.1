.PP
Manifest files can be stacked on one another.  The inherit directive indicates
the parent of the manifest file being processed.  Inheritance may be nested
(i.e. manifest A may inherit from manifest B, and B may inherit from manifest
C).  However multiple inheritance is not allowed.  Inherited files have their
repository and manifest groups merged.  The options group is overridden by child
option groups

.B repositories = ( ... )
.PP
The repositories group represents the set of yum repositories that this utility
will search for the manifest designated rpms.
