<p>Freight is a system for creating and managing containers using existing
packaging tools and distribution mechanisms.  Freight focuses on using a
distributions existing infrastructure tools to create, distribute and manage
containers on host systems across a site.  Doing so enables reuse of
administrative skills and distribution features to create a robust, flexible and
secure managed container environment.</p>

<p>Freight uses well established packaging mechanisms (currently rpm/yum, but
others can easily be added).  To transform a manifest of standard packages into
a container file system.  This has the advantage of ensuring that the package
manifest is included in the container image so that it can be administratively
interrogated later using those same tools (most notably to determine the need
for package updates)</p>

<p>Containerized file systems are then packaged into their own rpm, which provides
several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reuse of existing distribution mechanisms (yum repositories)</li>
<li>Clear, well understood versioning that is human readable</li>
<li>Ease of updates on remote container hosts</li>
</ul>

<a id="update-detection" class="anchor" href="#update-detection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Update detection</h2>

<p>A key tenet of distribution packaging is the ability to identify the need to
update a package on a system (for security fixes/enhancements/etc).  By reusing
those distribution mechanisms, the same advantages can be applied to containers.
Freight allows a container rpm to be installed temporarily and inspected using
yum so that the need for updates can be reported to an administrator, and
appropriate action can be taken</p>

<h2>
<a id="manifest-level-inheritance" class="anchor" href="#manifest-level-inheritance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Manifest Level inheritance</h2>

<p>Containers are generally considered to be immutable.  This gives rise to the
need to create layered containers in order to address the need for customization
at a given site.  While layering (via unionfs or overlayfs) provides an elegant
solution to the problem, it also creates an issue with aliasing, in which the
contents of a base layer image may be masked by a higher layer image, leading to
potential security holes.  Freight addresses this by preforming inheritance at
the manifest level.  By using distribution packaging dependency resolution and
versioning, even inherited/layered lists of packages can be resolved to a single
set of packages at their latest versions, ensuing that you know what will be
executed in a container.</p>
